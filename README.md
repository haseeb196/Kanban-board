# Kraftbase Frontend Engineer Assignment Submission - Abdul Haseeb

## Overview

This project is a kanban board application developed using React/Next.js and TypeScript. It allows users to manage tasks and categories, add labels to tasks, search, filter, and sort tasks, and authenticate users.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

This project was an exciting opportunity to demonstrate proficiency in frontend development while tackling real-world challenges. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this assignment and look forward to any feedback or further discussions.

## special Note
- I didn't add the drag and drop feature, and perhaps it's not responsive for smaller devices because I didn't have much time for the task submission.
-  label feature only work with severity and not for custom labels, but u can add custom labels and status button doesn't work 
- all other features are implemented

- some features requires a database but I only used state management & localStorage .
